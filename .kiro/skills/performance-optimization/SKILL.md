# Performance Optimization

## Overview

Measure before optimizing. Performance work without measurement is guessing — and guessing leads to premature optimization that adds complexity without improving what matters. Profile first, identify the actual bottleneck, fix it, measure again.

## When to Use

- Performance requirements exist in the spec (load time budgets, response time SLAs)
- Users or monitoring report slow behavior
- Core Web Vitals scores are below thresholds
- You suspect a change introduced a regression
- Building features that handle large datasets or high traffic

**When NOT to use:** Don't optimize before you have evidence of a problem.

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 |

## The Optimization Workflow

```
1. MEASURE  → Establish baseline with real data
2. IDENTIFY → Find the actual bottleneck (not assumed)
3. FIX      → Address the specific bottleneck
4. VERIFY   → Measure again, confirm improvement
5. GUARD    → Add monitoring or tests to prevent regression
```

### Where to Start

```
What is slow?
├── First page load
│   ├── Large bundle? → Measure bundle size, check code splitting
│   ├── Slow server response? → Measure TTFB in Network waterfall
│   └── Render-blocking resources? → Check CSS/JS blocking in waterfall
├── Interaction feels sluggish
│   ├── UI freezes on click? → Profile main thread, look for long tasks (>50ms)
│   ├── Form input lag? → Check re-renders, controlled component overhead
│   └── Animation jank? → Check layout thrashing, forced reflows
├── Page after navigation
│   ├── Data loading? → Measure API response times, check for waterfalls
│   └── Client rendering? → Profile component render time
└── Backend / API
    ├── Single endpoint slow? → Profile DaaS queries, check indexes
    ├── All endpoints slow? → Check connection pool, memory, CPU
    └── Intermittent slowness? → Check for lock contention, GC pauses
```

## Fix Common Anti-Patterns

### N+1 Queries (DaaS)

```typescript
// BAD: Separate fetch per related item
for (const task of tasks) {
  task.owner = await fetch(`/api/users/${task.ownerId}`);
}

// GOOD: Use DaaS deep query with fields parameter
const tasks = await fetch('/api/items/tasks?fields=*,owner.*');
```

### Unnecessary Re-renders (React)

```tsx
// BAD: Creates new object on every render
function TaskList() {
  return <TaskFilters options={{ sortBy: 'date', order: 'desc' }} />;
}

// GOOD: Stable reference
const DEFAULT_OPTIONS = { sortBy: 'date', order: 'desc' } as const;
function TaskList() {
  return <TaskFilters options={DEFAULT_OPTIONS} />;
}
```

### Large Bundle Size (Next.js)

```typescript
// GOOD: Dynamic import for heavy features
const ChartLibrary = lazy(() => import('./ChartLibrary'));

// GOOD: Route-level code splitting (Next.js does this automatically)
// Each page in app/ is automatically code-split
```

### Unbounded Data Fetching

```typescript
// BAD: Fetching all records
const all = await fetch('/api/items/tasks');

// GOOD: Paginated with DaaS
const page = await fetch('/api/items/tasks?limit=20&offset=0&sort=-date_created');
```

## Performance Budget

```
JavaScript bundle: < 200KB gzipped (initial load)
CSS: < 50KB gzipped
Images: < 200KB per image (above the fold)
API response time: < 200ms (p95)
Lighthouse Performance score: ≥ 90
```

## Next.js / DaaS Specific Tips

- Use Server Components by default (reduces client JS)
- Use `'use client'` only when needed (event handlers, hooks, browser APIs)
- Use `next/image` for automatic image optimization
- Use `next/font` for font optimization
- Leverage DaaS aggregate API for counts/sums instead of fetching all records
- Use DaaS `fields` parameter to fetch only needed fields
- Use DaaS `filter` parameter server-side instead of client-side filtering

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We'll optimize later" | Performance debt compounds. Fix obvious anti-patterns now. |
| "It's fast on my machine" | Your machine isn't the user's. Profile on representative hardware. |
| "This optimization is obvious" | If you didn't measure, you don't know. Profile first. |
| "Users won't notice 100ms" | Research shows 100ms delays impact conversion rates. |
| "The framework handles performance" | Frameworks can't fix N+1 queries or oversized bundles. |

## Red Flags

- Optimization without profiling data to justify it
- N+1 query patterns in data fetching
- List endpoints without pagination
- Images without dimensions, lazy loading, or responsive sizes
- Bundle size growing without review
- No performance monitoring in production
- `React.memo` and `useMemo` everywhere (overusing is as bad as underusing)

## Verification

After any performance-related change:

- [ ] Before and after measurements exist (specific numbers)
- [ ] The specific bottleneck is identified and addressed
- [ ] Core Web Vitals are within "Good" thresholds
- [ ] Bundle size hasn't increased significantly
- [ ] No N+1 queries in new data fetching code
- [ ] Existing tests still pass (optimization didn't break behavior)
